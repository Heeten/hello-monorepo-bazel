# Conclusion

Congratulations on making it this far! At this point hopefully you've seen how Bazel can be used to build an
end-to-end system.

One catch-22 with Bazel is most of the benefits accrue as a repo get larger and more complicated, but it's harder to
migrate an existing set of repos/crates/projects to Bazel after its evolved organically. Hopefully this doc helps you
see how to get started while things are simple and manageble.
