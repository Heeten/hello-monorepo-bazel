# Pulling in external crates like Clap

We'll use [cargo raze](https://github.com/google/cargo-raze). There's a newer alternate way to pull crates.io crates
into bazel using [crate universe](http://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html) that we don't cover here.
With cargo raze you create a `Cargo.toml` file to specify the crates.io crates you will depend on and use the
`raze` extension to create Bazel rules for compiling each of these. The dependencies can be vendored, but we'll
use the non-vendored mode in the examples below.

If you're starting from our blank VM we'll need to install rust and cargo. Using [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) instructions:
```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Next lets install `cargo raze`
```shell
#TODO
```

Now that we have Cargo, lets add some crates to our Bazel repo. We'll put our third-party rust dependencies under the `//third_party/rust` path in our repo. First let's make that
directory:
```shell
mkdir $HOME/repo/third_party
mkdir $HOME/repo/third_party/rust
```

Now lets make `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust/Cargo.toml` and follow the [raze instructions](https://github.com/google/cargo-raze#generate-a-cargotoml) for this:
```
[package]
name = "compile_with_bazel"
version = "0.0.0"

# Mandatory (or Cargo tooling is unhappy)
[lib]
path = "fake_lib.rs"

[dependencies]
log = "0.4.17"

[package.metadata.raze]
# The path at which to write output files.
#
# `cargo raze` will generate Bazel-compatible BUILD files into this path.
# This can either be a relative path (e.g. "foo/bar"), relative to this
# Cargo.toml file; or relative to the Bazel workspace root (e.g. "//foo/bar").
workspace_path = "//third_party/rust"

# This causes aliases for dependencies to be rendered in the BUILD
# file located next to this `Cargo.toml` file.
package_aliases_dir = "."

# The set of targets to generate BUILD rules for.
targets = [
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
]

# The two acceptable options are "Remote" and "Vendored" which
# is used to indicate whether the user is using a non-vendored or
# vendored set of dependencies.
genmode = "Remote"

default_gen_buildrs = true
```

Now from the `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust` directory run cargo raze
```shell
cd $HOME/repo/third_party/rust
cargo raze
```

This should create a few different files in that directory, and a remote directory.
The `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust/BUILD.bazel` file creates a new `:log` target which
allows you to depend on the log crate. We can add `//third_party/rust:log` to the `deps`
attribute of our `rust_library` and `rust_binary` rules to pull in the `log` crate.

We also need to update `$HOME/repo/WORKSPACE` to pull down the remote crates. Add this to the
bottom of `WORKSPACE`:
```python
### Cargo raze deps
###
load("//third_party/rust:crates.bzl", "raze_fetch_remote_crates")

# Note that this method's name depends on your gen_workspace_prefix setting.
# `raze` is the default prefix.
raze_fetch_remote_crates()
```

Let's add `log` to our library by editing `$HOME/repo/src/summation/BUILD` and updating
the rust_library deps to say:
```python
rust_library(
    name = "src_summation",
    srcs = [
        "lib.rs",
        "f64.rs",
        "u32.rs",
    ],
    deps = ["//third_party/rust:log"],
)
```

Now lets use `log` in `f64.rs` by changing the top of the file to this:
```rust
use log::trace;

pub fn summation_f64(values: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    trace!("summation_f64");
    values.iter().sum()
}
```

Then lets rebuild and see what happens:
```shell
$ bazel build //...
INFO: Analyzed 5 targets (5 packages loaded, 43 targets configured).
INFO: Found 5 targets...
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.326s, Critical Path: 1.91s
INFO: 14 processes: 5 internal, 9 linux-sandbox.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 14 total actions
```

You should see some output showing it's pulling down the third party crates and then everything compiles.

## Adding Clap
Now let's add clap. We'll see there's a gotcha we need to deal with for that crate due to Bazel's sandboxing.

First we'll add Clap along with the `derive` featur to `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust/Cargo.toml` under the `[dependencies]` section:
```
[dependencies]
log = "0.4.17"
clap = { version = "4.2.2", features = ["derive"] }
```

Then lets rerun `cargo raze` from `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust`
```shell
cd $HOME/repo/third_party/rust
cargo raze
```

You might see a warning about needing to run `cargo generate-lockfile`. We can delete `Cargo.raze.lock` and rerun
cargo raze to update versions of packages and create a new lockfile.
```shell
rm Cargo.raze.lock
cargo raze
```

Now lets go back to `$HOME/repo/src/summation/BUILD` and add `"//third_party/rust:log"` to our binary `deps`, resulting
in:
```python
rust_binary(
    #We are going to call the target/binary summation
    name = "executable",
    #The list of src files it needs (just main.rs)
    srcs = ["main.rs"],
    #Any libraries/crates it depends on, for now we'll leave this blank
    deps = [
        ":src_summation",
        "//third_party/rust:clap",
    ],
    #The crate_root file, this would default to main.rs but we put it in for clarity
    crate_root = "main.rs",
)
```

We'll try to build it before actually updating main.rs to use the code by running `bazel build //...`

And it fails with output looking like:
```

INFO: Found 5 targets...

```

What's going on here? It's hard to believe the clap release from crates.io doesn't build, but that's what Bazel tells us.
If you look at the error, you see it's using the `include_str!` macro not being able to find `../README.md`. Back in the hello world chapter we mentioned Bazel tries to ensure [hermetic builds](https://bazel.build/basics/hermeticity) by compiling code in a sandbox. One goal of the sandbox is to ensure you can't depend on anything that you haven't told Bazel explictly about. By default, cargo raze tells Bazel to bring over all the `*.rs` files, but it doesn't specify the compile needs  `README.md`. We can set an option to tell it we need this by adding these lines to `$HOME/repo/third_party/rust/Cargo.toml`:
```
[package.metadata.raze.crates.clap.'*']
compile_data_attr = "glob([\"**/*.md\"])"

[package.metadata.raze.crates.clap_builder.'*']
compile_data_attr = "glob([\"**/*.md\"])"

[package.metadata.raze.crates.clap_derive.'*']
compile_data_attr = "glob([\"**/*.md\"])"
```

Then let's run cargo raze again to get it to regen the third party crate build files.
```shell
cargo raze
```

And try building again
```shell
bazel build //...
```

At this point it should have built and you should be able to run your executable:
```shell
bazel run //src/summation:executable -- 0.0 1.0 2.0
```

That should output `sum = 3`. For completeness let's open up `$HOME/repo/src/summation/main.rs` and use clap
to parse the args. The final code we'll end up there will be:
```rust
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};
use src_summation::f64::summation_f64;
use src_summation::u32::summation_u32;

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Cmd {
    U32 { args: Vec<String> },
    F64 { args: Vec<String> },
}

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Arguments {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    cmd: Cmd,
}

fn main() {
    let args = Arguments::parse();
    match args.cmd {
        Cmd::U32 { args } => {
            let args: Vec<u32> = args.into_iter().map(|a| a.parse().unwrap()).collect();
            println!("sum = {}", summation_u32(&args))
        }
        Cmd::F64 { args } => {
            let args: Vec<f64> = args.into_iter().map(|a| a.parse().unwrap()).collect();
            println!("sum = {}", summation_f64(&args))
        }
    }
}
```

Which we can run and get the help usage for by running:
```shell
bazel run //src/summation:executable -- --help
```

Which shows us:
```
